Introduction

This report documents my progress in learning Python coding during my third day of study. Over the course of the day, I explored several fundamental concepts in Python programming, including Hello World and the print command, conditional statements (if-else), mathematical operations, variables, and data types. I also had the opportunity to apply these concepts by working on various small projects, including a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator, a tip calculator, and programs to determine if a number is odd or even and whether it's a leap year.

Day 3 Learning Highlights

Hello World and Print Command: The day began with a simple yet essential Python tradition: printing "Hello, World!" to the console. This served as an introduction to Python syntax and the print command, which is used to display text and variables.

Conditional Statements (if-else): I delved into conditional statements, particularly the if-else construct. This enabled me to make decisions in my code based on certain conditions. For example, I learned how to create a program that checks if a number is greater or less than a specific threshold and takes different actions accordingly.

Math Operations: Understanding mathematical operations in Python was another crucial step. I practiced using arithmetic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to perform calculations within my programs.

Variables and Data Types: I explored the concept of variables, which allow me to store and manipulate data in my programs. Additionally, I familiarized myself with fundamental data types in Python, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

Projects

I had the opportunity to apply my newfound knowledge through practical projects:

BMI Calculator: I created a BMI calculator program that takes a person's weight and height as input and calculates their BMI. This project helped reinforce my understanding of mathematical operations and variables.

Tip Calculator: Another useful project involved building a tip calculator. Given a bill amount and a desired tip percentage, the program calculates the tip amount and the total bill. This project reinforced the use of variables and mathematical operations.

Odd or Even Checker: I designed a program to determine if a given number is odd or even. This project involved using conditional statements to make decisions based on the properties of the input number.

Leap Year Checker: Finally, I tackled a program that checks whether a year is a leap year or not. This project allowed me to practice conditional statements further, as leap year calculation involves specific rules.

Conclusion

My third day of learning Python was both productive and instructive. I solidified my grasp of fundamental concepts such as conditional statements, mathematical operations, variables, and data types. Additionally, I applied this knowledge effectively by working on practical projects, including a BMI calculator, tip calculator, and programs to determine odd or even numbers and leap years. As I continue my Python journey, I look forward to expanding my skill set and taking on more complex programming challenges.
